By default ansible reads the inventory file present at /etc/ansible/hosts for doing remote configuration

To make anyother files as inventory file we can use -i option

Create a new inventory file
vim myinventory
192.168.60.23
192.168.60.22
Save and quit

To use the above file
ansible all -i myinventory -m command a- 'ls -l'

To make myinventory files as the default file
Open ansible.cfg file

sudo vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
Go to [defaults] section
Uncomment the inventory line and specify the path of myinventory
file over here

ansible.cfg file locations
---------------------------
1 The default ansible.cfg file is present in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  This is the last priority file.ansible.cfg file can be present at four different locations and priority is given based on that location

 1st priority is given for the config file whose path is stored in
 ANSIBLE_CONFIG variable.

  ANSIBLE_CONFIG=Path of our customised ansible.cfg file

 If the above variable is not available it will search for the present
 working directory if any ansible.cfg file is present and execute  based on  it

 If ansible.cfg file is not present in pwd then it will look for 
  .ansible.cfg file which may be present in the home directory of the
  user and execute it

 If none of the above configuration files are present then ansible
 will execute /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file
